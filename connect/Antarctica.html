                    Antarctica is a continent unto itself and is not a part of any country. 
                    The Great White Continent is governed under a series of recognised guidelines and agreements called the Antarctic Treaty System. 
                    Twelve countries signed the Antarctic Treaty in 1959 and the agreement currently has 54 signatories.
                    Although Antarctica has never had an indigenous population, seven nations have claimed parts of the continent
                     – New Zealand, Australia, France, Norway, the United Kingdom, Chile and Argentina. Some of these territories overlap.
                      The United States, Russia and Brazil all have a permanent presence in Antarctica, but haven't currently claimed territory.
                       Most of these ten countries have established scientific research centres, where around 4000 people work and live in Antarctica over summer, 
                       with numbers reducing to around 1000 in winter. 
                       The vast majority of the population are scientists; some are operational staff, like ships' crews and service workers.
